# 42-libft
First project of Hive Helsinki! I have written most of the code when I started at Hive. This is small library with basic C functions. 
There might be few fixes which are against the original libft instuctions.
## Description ##
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.
